# RFC0006: React Native as a monorepo

## Summary

This proposal is not much as in introducing something completely new, but more to discuss a solution to an existing problem. To put simply, the current shape of the `react-native` codebase hosted in GitHub is lacking structure and consistency and this is leading to a number of issues (detailed below).

This proposal is about re-shaping the existing codebase on GitHub into what is commonly expected of a monorepo in the JavaScript ecosystem (see, for example, [Babel.js](https://github.com/babel/babel) or [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)): consistent versioning, naming and tooling.

## Motivation

To quickly explain the motivation behind this proposal, here's the current shape of the React Native codebase hosted on GitHub and corrispective npm packages:

![current status of the react-native GitHub codebase](/proposals/assets/0006-current-status.png "Current Status")

It should quickly become apparent that there are a few discrepancies:

- naming convention is not consistent (ex. `@react-native/assets`, `react-native-codegen`, `@react-native-community/eslint-plugin`)
- semver versioning is not consistent (certain packages are on a major version such as `@react-native/assets`, others are on a patch level such as `@react-native/babel-plugin-codegen`)
- semver is not aligned or coordinated with the `react-native` package semver
- no changelogs for any of these other packages

On top of this, there are some more substantial issues:

- releasing a new version of any package that is not the main `react-native` one requires an engineer manually releasing it via CLI on a local machine (which is potentially also a security issue, given how some of these packages are owned by members of the community)

  - which also means that the same person then needs to manually bump the dependency in other parts of the codebase, since they are fixed. For example, see how root level package.json depends on `"@react-native/polyfills": "2.0.0",` ([permalink](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/b331229b06dde31ff92091a163cfabb030082925/package.json#L108)).

- because of the root `package.json` being not just the `react-native` package but also the root/CI for the repo, during the release script for `react-native` there's some ðŸª„magicðŸª„ that happens to copy over some dependencies from `repo-config/package.json` into the root one (see [this commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6efb51777c620a95e457488fbc7df5c272b3c695#diff-7ae45ad102eab3b6d7e7896acd08c427a9b25b346470d7bc6507b6481575d519)). It's a weird pattern that is undocumented and I'm scared of the issues it creates, since (as all the others) `repo-config/package.json` is manually maintained.
  - for example, 0.69.0-rc0 was still depending on React 17 in the 0.69 branch; it was addressed afterwards with [this commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a862d9294bf22ba2304fe5d742010dc210a2ef5a)

## The Proposal - detailed design

**// WIP**

### Going the extra mile: Hermes

An element that is not presented in the graph above is Hermes engine as a package in this repo (ex. `@react-native/hermes-engine`). This is intentional as it's a more complicated subject, but it's interesting to mention, given the recent decision to move Hermes to a "build from source" scenario ([details](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/4#discussioncomment-2382960)).

An interesting option could be to have it yes as a subfolder (via [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), maybe?) and handle it as all the other packages above (even for versioning & publishing).

Another option, that would build on top of the (new) existing process, would still rely on git tags on the `facebook/hermes-engine` repo, but would basically "pull that code" within a `<root>/packages/hermes-engine` folder and handle the release process of Hermes (and its build process) inside it, and publish the artifacts & pre-build separately from the main `react-native` node_module. This would help alleviate the problem of the main `react-native` module being too heavy, and re-align Hermes' versioning to the `react-native` one.

### Implementation detail considerations

- This work will have to start from Meta's side (see [comments in the other proposal](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/49/files#r255135557))
- Since Metro by default doesn't handle symlinks well, it could be that for RN Tester to keep working we might have to add [`@rnx-kit/metro-resolver-symlinks`](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit/tree/main/packages/metro-resolver-symlinks)
- the changelog generator will need to be worked on to accomodate generating changelogs for any or all or some of the packages in the new monorepo structure

### Other considerations

- we could consired renaming `react-native` into `@react-native/core` but no strong opinion; given how this is the "front-facing" package it might be easier and more digestable for consumers of react-native to just keep stay on the current convention.

## Drawbacks

- Most of it needs to be tackled in "one fell swoop"
- Old open pull requests will likely need to be rebased and re-arranged
- Some of the native build scripts (gradle, BUCK, xcode, etc.) and CI scripts and config will need to be updated for the new code locations

- _(Adding this bullet point to easily allow comments on other drawbacks that might have not been considered)_

## Alternatives

Since this is basically a fix and not a re-invention, alternatives have not been really explored deeply. Most of the alternative takes boil down to tech choices details in ex. which tool to use to handle the monorepo setup, and not really in the final overall shape of the codebase.

## Adoption strategy

There's not really a need for an adoption strategy per se, we just ensure to complete this workstream before a given new 0.XX minor branch cut & RC process start, and communicate that as a step to upgrade to the new version that folks will have to change the name & version or certain packages to the new one ( since `react-native` will stay `react-native`, to many folks this will be transparent).

Tools like [`dep-check`](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit/tree/main/packages/dep-check) or a codemod should be enough to support edge-cases in which some packages where imported directly.

No breaking changes are expected, it's just a matter of naming & semver convention re-alignment.

## How we teach this

Nothing to teach, we just need to ensure that the first version to be released after this will have the documentation and blogpost communicate accordingly the new package names (but since `react-native` will stay `react-native`, to many folks this will be transparent).
